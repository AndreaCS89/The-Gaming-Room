# The-Gaming-Room

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is available in an Android app only. Our client is requesting help with streamlining the development of the game.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I ensured throughout the process that my design constraints were clearly listed with sufficient information to address limitations. I also ensured to add in-line comments during the creation of the different classes to document my progress with clear and detailed information. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Something that I found helpful when developing code was to work on one class at a time. I ensured that in-line comments were added as I fixed the different errors that would appear throughout the development of the code, and added clear and detailed information that would help future developers follow it. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would probably pick the class "ProgramDriver.java". How I would improve it would be by adding more in-line comments. I believe that this is key to helping other developers make changes as necessary. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Based on what our client requested, I researched the design constraints, evaluated each side of the software development based on the server side, client side, and the available development tools, and recommended what we believe would fit best based on their necessities. I believe that it is important to consider the user's needs when designing as we want to ensure that the software is developed following as much as we can the client's expectations. Although at times it might not be possible to follow exactly our client's expectations, it is always possible to recommend techniques and characteristics of different systems architectures that will meet their requirements.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I studied thoroughly the different needs that our client expressed to us and, based on these needs, I began by creating a software design template that reflected the different areas that needed improvement. In the future, I would begin by requesting information regarding the areas in which our company could help our future clients. Based on those, I would begin creating a similar project software design document that reflected areas such as requirements, design constraints, system architecture view, and domain model among other things. This would help us and our client have a clear view of how we will address the different necessities and make changes on the go that would accommodate our client's expectations.
